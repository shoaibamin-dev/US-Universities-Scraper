# US Universities Scraping Project

This Selenium Python project is designed to scrape details of all US universities from the [4icu.org](https://www.4icu.org/us/universities/) website. The goal is to extract comprehensive information about each university and generate a file containing the aggregated details.

## Project Overview

The project primarily involves web scraping using Selenium, a powerful tool for automating browser interactions. The target website, [4icu.org](https://www.4icu.org/us/universities/), lists various universities, and the scraper collects details such as:

- University name
- Website
- Address
- Phone number
- Description

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the project:

- Python
- Selenium
- Webdriver (compatible with your browser)

Install Python dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Additionally, download the appropriate webdriver for your browser and set the path in the script.

## Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd us-universities-scraping
   ```

3. Set up your virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Download the appropriate webdriver for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and set the path in the `scraper.py` script.

6. Run the scraper:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

   The script will start scraping the university details from the website.

## Generated File

Once the scraping process is complete, the script will generate a file containing the details of all US universities. The filename and format can be configured in the script.

## Additional Notes

- This project relies on web scraping, and it's essential to be mindful of the website's terms of service.
- It's recommended to run the scraper responsibly to avoid any potential impact on the target website.
